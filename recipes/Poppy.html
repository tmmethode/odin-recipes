			<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>These rhubarb muffins toe the line between muffin and cupcakeâ€“but are delicious nonetheless. The vanilla-poppy seed muffin base contrasts nicely with the tart rhubarb.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened </li>

<li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>

<li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>

<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>

<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds</li>

<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

<li>1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt</li>

<li>1 1/2 cups finely chopped rhubarb</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line two muffin pans with liners.

</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn the mixer speed up to medium-high, and beat batter until it is very light and fluffy, and has lightened in color, about 5 minutes. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts.</li>
			<li>Add in 1 cup flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg and mix on low speed until just combined. Add in yogurt and mix until just combined. Add in remaining 1 cup flour and mix until just incorporated. Fold in chopped rhubarb.
</li>
			<li>Divide batter between the lined muffin cups, filling each one about 3/4 full.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until muffins spring back lightly when touched, 20 to 23 minutes. Allow muffins to cool in the pan a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
			</ol>
