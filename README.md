# odin-recipes
hello
This project contains index page and 3 other recipes pages,
Index page is the first page end user will view when he/she opens the project (homepage) and index page includes links of other 3 recipes 

This project will help me to understand basics of html, css and JavaScript and i will know how to use Git and GitHub.
So this will help me to know how to i can collaborate with other people and sharing codes using github
